1. It will return 3, the time discountPrices runs for the given input, because the variable i is accessable in the function and record the length of the prices array.
2. It will return 150, the discounted value for the last element calculated, because the variable discountedPrice can only store one value and on line 13 it will be the last element calculted.
3. It will return 150, the rounded final price for the last element calculated, because the variable finalPrice can only store one value and on line 13 it will be the last element rounded.
4. It will return the array of final discounted values, but print nothing, because the rounded discounted prices will be pushed to this array one by on in the for loop on line 9, but there is not print statement.
5. It will return an error, because the variable i cannot be accessed on line 12.
6. It will return an error, because the variable i cannot be accessed on line 13.
7. It will still return 150 because the variable finalPrice is accessable within the discountPrices function.
8. It will return the array of final discounted values, but print nothing, because the rounded discounted prices will be pushed to this array one by on in the for loop on line 9, but there is not print statement. The let statement won't affect the outcome.
9. It will return an error, because the variable i cannot be accessed on line 12.
10. It will return 3, the length of the orginal prices, because we assigned this value to the variable length on line 4.
11. It will return the array of final discounted values, but print nothing, because the rounded discounted prices will be pushed to this array one by on in the for loop on line 8, but there is not print statement. The const statement won't affect the outcome.

31. == checks for equality of values only, while === checks for both equality of values and types.
32. The result will be [2,4,6]. The modifyArray function takes an array and a callback function as parameters. When modifyArray([1, 2, 3], doSomething) is called, the doSomething function multiplies each element of the array by 2.
33. It will output 1 and 4 immediately, 3 after a delay of 0 millisecond, and 4 after a delay of 1 second.
